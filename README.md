# d_bot - 

main goal was to make it use for searching and playing songs from youtube :) 
now I am just doing it for fun.

This bot is hosted in heroku... online version have some issues with connecting to voice channel or searching right now. But works if code is run locally - on anyones PC. <3

from VScode console/ terminal run this command - 

				node index.js

needs ffmpeg, node js installed on the environment :)
